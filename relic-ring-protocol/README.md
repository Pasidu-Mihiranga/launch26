# Relic Ring Protocol - Zeta-26 Star System Routing Simulator

> **IEEE Computer Society - Launch 26 Phase 01 Challenge**  
> University of Kelaniya

An interplanetary routing protocol simulator that models data packet transmission
across the Zeta-26 star system - a 6-planet network with Base-N codex translations,
multi-hop latency calculations, and chaos-resilient routing.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pygame-ce (`pip install pygame-ce`)

### Installation
```bash

## Algorithm Justification

### Why Dijkstra? (OSPF Standard)
Dijkstra's algorithm is the industry standard for shortest-path routing in real-world
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocols. It provides:
- **Guaranteed optimality** for non-negative edge weights
- **O((V+E) log V)** time complexity with binary heap
- **Deterministic results** for reproducible latency calculations

### A* Heuristic Admissibility Proof
The A* heuristic `h(n) = straight_line_distance(n, dest) / C` is **provably admissible**:

1. The shortest physical distance between two planets is a straight line
2. The fastest possible speed is the speed of light `C`
3. Actual paths traverse atmospheres (n > 1.0 slows light), fiber cables (0.67c),
   and incur tower processing delays (7ms each)
4. Therefore: `h(n) = distance/C <= actual_cost` always holds
5. Since h(n) never overestimates, A* is optimal

**Verification:** All 30 directed pairs cross-validated: Dijkstra cost == A* cost.

### Yen's K=3 for O(1) Failover
Pre-computing 3 shortest paths per source-destination pair enables instant failover
when a node is killed during the Chaos Test, without re-running Dijkstra at failure time.

## Physical Constants

| Constant | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Speed of Light (C) | 300,000 km/s | `universe-config.json` |
| Coordinate Scale (S) | 100,000 km/unit | `universe-config.json` |
| Max Void Hop (Lmax) | 50,000,000 km | `universe-config.json` |
| Tower Delay | 7.0 ms | `universe-config.json` |
| Fiber Speed Fraction | 0.67 | `universe-config.json` |

### Key Formulas
```
Void Distance:    L = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2) * S - (R1+h1) - (R2+h2)
Void Travel Time: Tv = (h1*n1)/C + L/C + (h2*n2)/C
Crust Transit:    Tp = fiber_distance/(0.67*C) + m * 0.007s
```

## The 6-Planet Universe

## Demo Video Guide

### M1: Universe Initialization
- App launches, loads `universe-config.json`
- Star map renders all 6 planets with tower dots
- All status LEDs show green
- Terminal shows cross-validation PASSED

### M2: Multi-Hop Routing Proof
1. Select Source: Aegis, Destination: Caelum
2. Payload field shows "Hello world" (default)
3. Click **SEND PACKET**
4. Watch the glowing packet animate along the route
5. Hop Log panel shows per-planet entry/exit towers
6. Codec panel shows Base-N translations at each hop

### M3: Latency Breakdown
- After sending a packet, the Latency panel auto-populates
- Bar chart shows Void (dominant), Fiber, and Tower components
- Total latency displayed at bottom

### M4: Chaos Test
1. Click **KILL NODE** (header shows "KILL MODE" LED)
2. Click a planet on the map (e.g., Dawn)
3. Planet turns red, edges become dashed
4. Route auto-reroutes avoiding the dead node
5. Packet integrity verified on new route
6. Click **REVIVE ALL** to restore
7. Original optimal route is restored

**Design Decision: Endpoint Failures**
If the Source or Destination node is killed *before* a transmission starts, the system blocks the request entirely without running routing algorithms. If either endpoint is killed *mid-flight* while a packet is in transit, the protocol instantly aborts the transmission since continuous availability of both endpoints is assumed for the duration of the transfer.

## Test Suite

25 automated tests across 4 test files:

```
tests/test_physics.py    - 5 tests (void distance, travel time, tower positions, crust transit)
tests/test_routing.py    - 6 tests (graph building, Dijkstra, A*, cross-validation, unreachable)
tests/test_resilience.py - 3 tests (Yen's K=3, kill/revive, DTN queue)
tests/test_codec.py      - 11 tests (base conversion, round-trips, spec examples, hop_log)
```
